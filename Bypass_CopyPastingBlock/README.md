### How to Use the Bookmarklet

This JavaScript code is a bookmarklet that helps bypass restrictions on copy/pasting text into input fields on certain websites. Follow these steps to use it:

1. **Create a Bookmark**:
    - Copy the entire JavaScript code provided above.
    - Open your browser's bookmarks manager.
    - Create a new bookmark and paste the JavaScript code into the "URL" or "Location" field of the bookmark.

2. **Navigate to the Target Website**:
    - Go to the website where you want to bypass the copy/paste block.

3. **Activate the Bookmarklet**:
    - Click on the bookmark you created in Step 1 while on the target website.

4. **Copy/Paste Your Content**:
    - You should now be able to copy/paste your content into the restricted input fields.

### How It Works

The script listens for various events (`paste`, `copy`, `cut`, `keydown`, etc.) on input fields, text areas, and content-editable elements. It stops these events from propagating, effectively disabling the restrictions imposed by the website. Additionally, it removes any inline event handlers (like `onpaste` or `onkeydown`) that might block pasting.
